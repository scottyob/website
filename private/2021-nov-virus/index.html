Covid test returned negative result</li></ul><p>Saturday 27th:</p><ul><li>Started throat soreness after coughing a bit, assumed I had torn my throat</li><li>Noticed it was worse the next morning and has been getting progressively worse since. Tonsillitis as white markings on tonsils</li><li>Tongue also feels a bit swollen with what I think must be a few ulcers on the back of my tongue, making eating, drinking and conversing difficult.</li><li>Strep test returned negative result</li></ul><p>Tuesday 30th:</p><ul><li>Barely got any sleep last night, was finding it hard to stay asleep with the pain. Was like a zombie for the day</li><li>Have worked out a lot of my mouth pain is coming from developing ulcers on my tongue. An ice block seems to be able to sooth them.</li><li>Night was my best night yet, perhaps it was the 2x ibuprofen, but the swelling in my tongue was down, I could talk normally, and drink a water bottle without too much pain</li></ul><p>Wednesday 1st:</p><ul><li>Believe I&rsquo;m slowly on the mend. Didn&rsquo;t sleep long stints because of congestion, snoring, and sore throat, which is a bit more inflamed than last night now</li><li>Things of concern is a feeling of &ldquo;pressure&rdquo; in my right inner ear, and right teeth. Perhaps an early sign of infection in sinuses? Something to keep an eye on.</li></ul><p>Thursday 2nd:</p><ul><li>Scary day, didn&rsquo;t sleep much on the wednesday night, but the swelling has spread so much that it feels bruised all on the right hand side of my face. There&rsquo;s more swelling in the mouth right up around my gums and teeth, and I&rsquo;m unable to open my mouth very wide, talking is hard, and I need to keep a close eye on this in case the swelling continues</li><li>Amazing how much it went down with some ibuprofen</li><li>Started course of Antibiotics as suggested by doctor, if it&rsquo;s not going away on its own, we might as well give this a go.</li></ul><p>Friday 3rd:</p><ul><li>Had a much better nights sleep, not much coughing or things to keep me up</li><li>Woke up with what I think is reduced swelling</li><li>It looks like the white areas around my tonsils are slowly going away.
Drugs:</li><li>8:30 both ibuprofen & antibiotics</li></ul><p>Questions:</p><ul><li>Other than the usual sleep, there’s nothing I ca do to speed this recovery up?</li><li>Is it concerning to not get over it after the first few days assuming it’s all the same virus, but have this drag on for weeks in waves? Should I be getting blood work and checking levels or something?</li></ul></section></article></main><footer class=site-footer><section class=rss><a class="subscribe-button icon-feed" href=/index.xml></a></section><section class=copyright>&copy; 2023 Scott O'Brien</section><section class=poweredby><a href=https://github.com/nirocfz/arabica>Arabica</a> theme by Sean Lunsford.
