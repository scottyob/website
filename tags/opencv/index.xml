I bought foam board from Dollar Tree. Having the free designs from Flite Test (Iâ€™m using their Simple Cub), it quickly became apparent that printing out the designs, cutting, lining them up, gluing, cutting takes hours and hours to cut out a design.
I want a CNC machine to do either laser cutting or sawing to save this time.</description></item></channel></rss>
