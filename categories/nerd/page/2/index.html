During the process of ensuring high availability (HA), I realized that many small companies might have similar need, but with more pressing tasks and limited man hours, without a post that talks about all the issues and solutions in one place, many companies and¬†organisations¬†tend to leave single points of failure living with the chance that they‚Äôre not going to fail any time soon. &mldr; <a class=read-more href=/2012/04/13/ha-network/>&#187;</a></p></section><footer class=post-meta><time class=post-date>April 13, 2012</time></footer></article><article class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title><a href=/2011/07/02/whats-the-harm-in-google-dns-performance/>What‚Äôs the harm in Google DNS?Performance!</a></h2></header><section class=post-excerpt><p>EDIT: It looks like Google has recently starting peering in more places in AU with an anycast solution that fixes these issues.
