The chessboard uses AWS IoT Shadow Service (MQTT accessed key-value store) to keep track of your and your opponents chess board state.

My plan is to build an NFT hydroponic system for the yard, and dutch bucket for tomatoes.
From my light study I found the fence and some areas that may make some good light.
I found https://university.upstartfarmers.com/blog/sizing-a-pump-hydroponics-aquaponics that describes NFT Hydroponics is 4-6 GPH required for my pump. I&rsquo;m going to start with one trough, but plan on scaling this up to 3 if it works, so will require 18GPH of total flow. &mldr; <a class=read-more href=/post/2022-01-02-nft-hydroponics/>&#187;</a></p></section><footer class=post-meta><time class=post-date>January 02, 2022</time></footer></article><article class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title><a href=/post/2021-10-10-light-study/>light-study</a></h2></header><section class=post-excerpt><p>When deciding what to attempt to grow where in the unit we&rsquo;re renting, I decided to perform a light study of the backyard.

We wanted to allow proxy-free internet, but wanted to keep an eye on how much data was being consumed by what sort of users. For this we built Project Herbert http://uowits.github.io/herbert-gui/docs.html.
It uses netflow from inside our network and some syslog monitoring scripts to match up our private RFC1918 address space to the users who have it at that time, process the flows in near-realtime so we can adjust throttling and firewall policy to be reactive with the environment. &mldr; <a class=read-more href=/2014/07/08/user-accounting-with-netflow/>&#187;</a></p></section><footer class=post-meta><time class=post-date>July 08, 2014</time></footer></article><article class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title><a href=/2014/02/24/finding-overlaps-in-address-space/>Finding overlaps in address space</a></h2></header><section class=post-excerpt><p>We have an interesting problem at my workplace, we have an MPLS VPN design for separation of security zones (e.g., staff from students.) and we don’t have MPLS support on our edge. With a L3 to the edge design though this means that while every edge switch has its own address space (per VRF), it also has a /30 uplink (once again, per VRF) back to the PE device.
While this (rightly or wrongly decided) slightly more complicated design in itself isn’t a problem, I’ve been working on programatically putting all of this data into an IPAM (IP Address Management) solution. &mldr; <a class=read-more href=/2014/02/24/finding-overlaps-in-address-space/>&#187;</a></p></section><footer class=post-meta><time class=post-date>February 24, 2014</time></footer></article><article class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title><a href=/2013/04/09/what-is-anycast/>What is Anycast?</a></h2></header><section class=post-excerpt><p>I’ve never found a really simple video on what exactly Anycast is with a basic examples when exploring the concepts.

Before We’ve got a pretty basic topology going on in our DC, it’s just a VSS with the other switches pretty much being nothing more but layer 2 for the most part. &mldr; <a class=read-more href=/2012/12/08/my-experiences-of-managing-a-cisco-switch-with-puppet/>&#187;</a></p></section><footer class=post-meta><time class=post-date>December 08, 2012</time></footer></article><article class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title><a href=/2012/11/08/address-book-for-a-the-blind/>Address Book For the Blind</a></h2></header><section class=post-excerpt><p><p>This article is about using the <a href=http://www.asterisk.org onclick='_gaq.push(["_trackEvent","outbound-article","http://www.asterisk.org"])'>Asterisk PBX</a> and exploiting <a href=http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/voicesearch/index.html onclick='_gaq.push(["_trackEvent","outbound-article","http://www.google.com"])'>Google’s voice recognition </a>API built for voice search in Chrome to build an address book that technology inept people (my grandmother) can use to place cheap telephone calls over VoIP.</p><p>This tool is built for my grandmother; a lady who has <a href=http://www.mdfoundation.com.au onclick='_gaq.push(["_trackEvent","outbound-article","http://www.mdfoundation.com.au"])'>macular degeneration</a> making her legally blind.  She doesn’t want to invest a great deal of money in this solution or have much of a learning curve, it took long enough to get her using the two button audio book solution on the iPod.  </p>&mldr; <a class=read-more href=/2012/11/08/address-book-for-a-the-blind/>&#187;</a></p></section><footer class=post-meta><time class=post-date>November 09, 2012</time></footer></article><article class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title><a href=/2012/07/31/zfs-and-apple-time-machine-a-perfect-team/>ZFS and Apple Time Machine, a perfect team</a></h2></header><section class=post-excerpt><p>So lately I’ve been thinking about my backup strategy on my Mac.

We’ve got a few sites around the place where we have HA internet powered by two Juniper SRX100’s. The Two SRX100’s operate in a Chassis Cluster and peer with our ISP using BGP across both active/passive devices.
Below is a little Nagios check script that I wrote to hook into our in-house Nagios monitoring platform. It makes sure the chassis cluster has not failed over operating in a degraded state, and makes sure that there are two BGP peers connected. &mldr; <a class=read-more href=/2012/07/09/monitoring-srx-chassis-cluster/>&#187;</a></p></section><footer class=post-meta><time class=post-date>July 09, 2012</time></footer></article><nav class=pagination role=navigation><span class=page-number>Page 1 of 3</span>
