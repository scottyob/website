I bought foam board from Dollar Tree. Having the free designs from Flite Test (I’m using their Simple Cub), it quickly became apparent that printing out the designs, cutting, lining them up, gluing, cutting takes hours and hours to cut out a design.
I want a CNC machine to do either laser cutting or sawing to save this time.</description></item><item><title>Ardupilot Postmortem</title><link>https://www.scottyob.com/post/ardupilot-postmortem/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/post/ardupilot-postmortem/</guid><description>A big thanks to those who helped from the Ardupilot Forum
Last week, I took a few extra days off from work to give myself a nice long break over Thanksgiving week.
I spent a lot of time finishing an RC plane we had some replacement parts for. This one was going to be autonomous. I spent a few days soldering the flight controller and electronics, gluing the plane together, measuring and trimming everything perfectly.</description></item><item><title>workflow-orchestration</title><link>https://www.scottyob.com/post/2022-10-05-workflow-orchestration/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/post/2022-10-05-workflow-orchestration/</guid><description>At Meta, we have a few internal workflow orchestration engines. The idea is to allow long-running jobs, or things that can be split into tasks and need to have safe &amp;ldquo;checkpoints&amp;rdquo; behind them be defined in a system that can safely execute them and make sure they&amp;rsquo;re executed in a durable, reliable and scalable way.

In Network Engineering at Facebook Meta, we&amp;rsquo;ve been going through an interesting transformation in which we&amp;rsquo;re starting to be discouraged to write new services in Python, and, instead start writing more in Rust (and sorry Golang, of which we&amp;rsquo;ve already got a bit written in.
I&amp;rsquo;ve always said that I&amp;rsquo;m not overly a smart person (though am stubborn enough to solve most problems), and don&amp;rsquo;t expect to be able to pick it up quickly, I decided to start learning by challenge tasks, do as much as I can in it, and document some here.</description></item><item><title>ESPChess NewGame Bug</title><link>https://www.scottyob.com/post/2022-04-05-chess-bug/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/post/2022-04-05-chess-bug/</guid><description>Ordering is a little off here, but I wanted to writeup about a bug I&amp;rsquo;m seeing in the ESPChess project (post to come) and how I intend to fix it.

My plan is to build an NFT hydroponic system for the yard, and dutch bucket for tomatoes.
From my light study I found the fence and some areas that may make some good light.
I found https://university.upstartfarmers.com/blog/sizing-a-pump-hydroponics-aquaponics that describes NFT Hydroponics is 4-6 GPH required for my pump. I&amp;rsquo;m going to start with one trough, but plan on scaling this up to 3 if it works, so will require 18GPH of total flow.</description></item><item><title>Hydroponic Kratky Lettuce Attempts</title><link>https://www.scottyob.com/post/2021-12-kratky-lettuce/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Dec 2021 11:01:04 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/post/2021-12-kratky-lettuce/</guid><description>This year i&amp;rsquo;ve decided to start playing with Hydroponics as a hobby. I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in starting with the Kratky Method of gardening. The idea is to grow lettuce in mason jars and see how growing without soil does. I&amp;rsquo;ve previously enjoyed growing my own alfalfa micro-greens, so this is the next obvious step.
Attempt #1 These didn&amp;rsquo;t go so good. I had planted some seedlings in Rockwool, and left them in a container out in the sun to act as a mini-greenhouse.</description></item><item><title>Custom Study Desk</title><link>https://www.scottyob.com/posts/custom-desk/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/posts/custom-desk/</guid><description>My partner and I recently started renting an old place in Palo Alto. With COVID, we&amp;rsquo;ve been working from home for almost two years now, and sharing a desk at times things felt a little cramped (especially with the occsional electronics project).
I&amp;rsquo;m no expert in woodwork, so decided to 3D model it before building the desk.

Over two nights, I knocked up a quick website to be able to upload igc flight files, and an xctask files to locally compute if you managed to hit the targets.
It&amp;rsquo;s something to play with more later, but I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to start putting these widgets into my logbook app to be able to log flights against tasks when they&amp;rsquo;re done.</description></item><item><title>resuming</title><link>https://www.scottyob.com/2021/09/11/resuming/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/2021/09/11/resuming/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve not been writing or blogging for some time. Over half a decade. It has been about 12 years since I started this blog, and a lot has changed since then. I&amp;rsquo;ve not found the time to document my tinkerings and projects as work has taken most of my time. I&amp;rsquo;m going to leave work related things on Linkedin, personal posts on Facebook, but I would like to continue using this site as my partner tends to use her diaries, as a way looking back at what I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with.</description></item><item><title>Very basic MPLS Tutorial</title><link>https://www.scottyob.com/2014/10/02/very-basic-mpls-tutorial/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2014 06:34:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/2014/10/02/very-basic-mpls-tutorial/</guid><description>I made this video a while ago and some people on YouTube seem to like it, so here is my very basic MPLS tutorial.

Usually this isn’t such a big problem, but add that with a design decision to route right to the access layer of our campus network with a multi-VRF network and you can start to see how mistakes, or changes in design along the deployment has meant inconsistencies.</description></item><item><title>User Accounting with Netflow</title><link>https://www.scottyob.com/2014/07/08/user-accounting-with-netflow/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2014 05:54:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/2014/07/08/user-accounting-with-netflow/</guid><description>At UOW we had a challenge. We wanted to allow proxy-free internet, but wanted to keep an eye on how much data was being consumed by what sort of users. For this we built Project Herbert http://uowits.github.io/herbert-gui/docs.html.
It uses netflow from inside our network and some syslog monitoring scripts to match up our private RFC1918 address space to the users who have it at that time, process the flows in near-realtime so we can adjust throttling and firewall policy to be reactive with the environment.</description></item><item><title>Logging NAT Translations on the Cisco ASA</title><link>https://www.scottyob.com/2014/05/08/logging-nat-translations-on-the-cisco-asa/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2014 06:14:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/2014/05/08/logging-nat-translations-on-the-cisco-asa/</guid><description>It’s often handy when dealing with infringement notices and the like to have NAT translations logged.

With a L3 to the edge design though this means that while every edge switch has its own address space (per VRF), it also has a /30 uplink (once again, per VRF) back to the PE device.
While this (rightly or wrongly decided) slightly more complicated design in itself isn’t a problem, I’ve been working on programatically putting all of this data into an IPAM (IP Address Management) solution.</description></item><item><title>Automating VLAN changes for ESXi Switchports in Cisco IOS.</title><link>https://www.scottyob.com/2014/01/29/automating-vlan-changes-for-esxi-switchports-in-cisco-ios/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jan 2014 10:51:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/2014/01/29/automating-vlan-changes-for-esxi-switchports-in-cisco-ios/</guid><description>At the organisation I’m currently working for, we recently experienced what appears to be a common issue, VLAN’s trunked down to ESXi nodes were inconsistent.

Not that I trust my DCs switches with puppet just yet, this is a proof of concept post about how we could be using puppet to centrally manage this configuration and push it out across our DC.
Before We’ve got a pretty basic topology going on in our DC, it’s just a VSS with the other switches pretty much being nothing more but layer 2 for the most part.</description></item><item><title>Address Book For the Blind</title><link>https://www.scottyob.com/2012/11/08/address-book-for-a-the-blind/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Nov 2012 00:32:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/2012/11/08/address-book-for-a-the-blind/</guid><description>&lt;p>This article is about using the &lt;a href="http://www.asterisk.org" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.asterisk.org']);">Asterisk PBX&lt;/a> and exploiting &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/voicesearch/index.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.google.com']);">Google’s voice recognition &lt;/a>API built for voice search in Chrome to build an address book that technology inept people (my grandmother) can use to place cheap telephone calls over VoIP.&lt;/p>

My scanner at home has a document feeder on it. The problem is that it doesn&amp;#8217;t do duplex, only a set of sides. So far, I can scan one side of the document, flip the paper of, then scan the back pages.</description></item><item><title>Apple feeling slow?</title><link>https://www.scottyob.com/2011/01/12/apple-feeling-slow/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2011 03:56:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/2011/01/12/apple-feeling-slow/</guid><description> Is your Apple Mac feeling slow? p.s. this is a joke, don&amp;#8217;t actually do it</description></item><item><title>Symfony not sortable in CRUD</title><link>https://www.scottyob.com/2011/01/01/symfony-not-sortable-generate-admin-crud/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2011 12:15:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/2011/01/01/symfony-not-sortable-generate-admin-crud/</guid><description>I&amp;#8217;ve recently come up across some problems with the CRUD generator in Symfony, so in case anyone is googling for a solution out there, I&amp;#8217;ll try and help you along (or at least bump up the page references to the articles that helped me 😉 ) I had a problem today where I was trying to use Symfony&amp;#8217;s (1.4) generate-admin CRUD generator. The issue was that my titles were not sortable when adjusting the fields to display in the generator.</description></item><item><title>Happy New Year – Resolution #1, Network &amp; Data</title><link>https://www.scottyob.com/2011/01/01/happy-new-year-resolution-1-network-data/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2011 12:02:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/2011/01/01/happy-new-year-resolution-1-network-data/</guid><description>It&amp;#8217;s a new year and time to start getting new years resolutions into action. I&amp;#8217;ve moved into my new area in the study so I&amp;#8217;ve started setting it up how I like. The first step is to get my router set up. The router I&amp;#8217;m using is a little &amp;#8216;fit-pc&amp;#8217; box with two ethernet cables. As you can see, it&amp;#8217;s pretty tiny but doesn&amp;#8217;t pack much in terms of power.</description></item><item><title>New Network</title><link>https://www.scottyob.com/2010/12/28/new-network/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Dec 2010 00:32:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/2010/12/28/new-network/</guid><description>so I&amp;#8217;ve moved back home with the family now. One thing I&amp;#8217;ve been meaning to do is to digitise my life and get set up on the cloud. I think it&amp;#8217;ll be really basic to start off with. VPN access in to my home network, firewall everything off, then create a few layers of the network. The issue is that I want to go paperless. I want to set up a ZFS Fileserver to store and snapshot all my data with remote encrypted backups of important documents and the like.</description></item><item><title>New upgdate</title><link>https://www.scottyob.com/2010/11/21/new-upgdate/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Nov 2010 08:02:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/2010/11/21/new-upgdate/</guid><description>So.. my router/firewall is due for an upgrade (from Lenny to Squeze) Big upgrade&amp;#8230; The following packages will be REMOVED: libdatrie0 libept0 libtorrent10 libxcb-xlib0 mysql-server mysql-server-5.0The following NEW packages will be installed: apache2.2-bin apt-xapian-index autopoint cpp-4.4 dash dbconfig-common diffutils dmsetup firmware-linux-free g++-4.4 gcc-4.4 gcc-4.4-base gconf2 gconf2-common geoip-database gnupg-curl grub-pc insserv install-info isc-dhcp-client isc-dhcp-common iso-codes javascript-common libalgorithm-diff-perl libalgorithm-diff-xs-perl libalgorithm-merge-perl libaprutil1-dbd-sqlite3 libaprutil1-ldap libasound2 libavahi-client3 libavahi-common-data libavahi-common3 libbind9-60 libboost-iostreams1.42.0 libbsd0 libc-bin libc-dev-bin libc6-i686 libcanberra-gtk-module libcanberra-gtk0 libcanberra0 libcroco3 libdatrie1 libdb4.</description></item><item><title>Home networking is back</title><link>https://www.scottyob.com/2010/11/07/home-networking-is-back/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Nov 2010 13:09:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/2010/11/07/home-networking-is-back/</guid><description>so, since I had the scare with my Asterisk VoIP box being hacked and a telephone call to Antarctica having being made, I decided to do something about it. My home network now consists of my D-Link Wireless router being put into Bridge mode, with all services pretty much turned off on the thing. My internal network is 10.12.0.0/16. I plan to sub-divide up this address space later, but for now, I&amp;#8217;m pretty much just keeping it in one big heap until I set up my servers and want to separate them further from the wireless workstations, for this reason though, I&amp;#8217;m keeping my setup pretty simple all pretty much in a 10.</description></item><item><title>A dawn of a new Scott</title><link>https://www.scottyob.com/2010/11/07/a-dawn-of-a-new-scott/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Nov 2010 10:07:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/2010/11/07/a-dawn-of-a-new-scott/</guid><description>More blogging to come. I saw a movie last night with Rebecca and one of her friends Kat. It was pretty good, we got to see Mark Zuckerberg&amp;#8216;s portrayal in The Social Network. It has made me realise a few things though. I mean, this guy is using open source tools to create some amazing things. I don&amp;#8217;t code half as much as I&amp;#8217;d like to any more.. this is going to change.</description></item><item><title>Backup your site!</title><link>https://www.scottyob.com/2010/10/09/backup-your-site/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Oct 2010 14:31:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/2010/10/09/backup-your-site/</guid><description>In my previous post I mentioned how I didn’t back up or migrate any of my data before we stopped paying the hosting company, so it’s all lost.
This has me thinking how much of a shame it would be if I build a wealth of information or a blog that I can use to identify myself and my work, only to have it go if the machine it’s hosted on dies.</description></item><item><title>A new blog</title><link>https://www.scottyob.com/2010/10/09/a-new-blog/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Oct 2010 01:30:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/2010/10/09/a-new-blog/</guid><description>Hello everyone. Ok, so this is a brand new blog. What happened to all my old content? I&amp;#8217;d like to say I just wanted to start fresh, but truth is, I was lazy and didn&amp;#8217;t back up any data from my hosting company before my term ended with them.. so I lost my database and content. I&amp;#8217;ll re-post the good stuff, hopefully more in-depth on this site though. Stay tuned.</description></item></channel></rss>
