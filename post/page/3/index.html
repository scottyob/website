Not that I trust my DCs switches with puppet just yet, this is a proof of concept post about how we could be using puppet to centrally manage this configuration and push it out across our DC.
Before We’ve got a pretty basic topology going on in our DC, it’s just a VSS with the other switches pretty much being nothing more but layer 2 for the most part. &mldr; <a class=read-more href=/2012/12/08/my-experiences-of-managing-a-cisco-switch-with-puppet/>&#187;</a></p></section><footer class=post-meta><time class=post-date>December 08, 2012</time></footer></article><article class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title><a href=/2012/11/08/address-book-for-a-the-blind/>Address Book For the Blind</a></h2></header><section class=post-excerpt><p><p>This article is about using the <a href=http://www.asterisk.org onclick='_gaq.push(["_trackEvent","outbound-article","http://www.asterisk.org"])'>Asterisk PBX</a> and exploiting <a href=http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/voicesearch/index.html onclick='_gaq.push(["_trackEvent","outbound-article","http://www.google.com"])'>Google’s voice recognition </a>API built for voice search in Chrome to build an address book that technology inept people (my grandmother) can use to place cheap telephone calls over VoIP.</p><p>This tool is built for my grandmother; a lady who has <a href=http://www.mdfoundation.com.au onclick='_gaq.push(["_trackEvent","outbound-article","http://www.mdfoundation.com.au"])'>macular degeneration</a> making her legally blind.  She doesn’t want to invest a great deal of money in this solution or have much of a learning curve, it took long enough to get her using the two button audio book solution on the iPod.  </p>&mldr; <a class=read-more href=/2012/11/08/address-book-for-a-the-blind/>&#187;</a></p></section><footer class=post-meta><time class=post-date>November 09, 2012</time></footer></article><article class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title><a href=/2012/07/31/zfs-and-apple-time-machine-a-perfect-team/>ZFS and Apple Time Machine, a perfect team</a></h2></header><section class=post-excerpt><p>So lately I’ve been thinking about my backup strategy on my Mac.

We’ve got a few sites around the place where we have HA internet powered by two Juniper SRX100’s. The Two SRX100’s operate in a Chassis Cluster and peer with our ISP using BGP across both active/passive devices.
Below is a little Nagios check script that I wrote to hook into our in-house Nagios monitoring platform. It makes sure the chassis cluster has not failed over operating in a degraded state, and makes sure that there are two BGP peers connected. &mldr; <a class=read-more href=/2012/07/09/monitoring-srx-chassis-cluster/>&#187;</a></p></section><footer class=post-meta><time class=post-date>July 09, 2012</time></footer></article><article class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title><a href=/2012/06/03/easily-accessing-geoip-restricted-sites-in-your-network/>Easily accessing GeoIP restricted sites in your network.</a></h2></header><section class=post-excerpt><p>We all know the problem, some sites are restricted to certain countries based on the IP address you’re using to view them.

Please see HA Network for the first part in setting up the network topology to be highly available.
It’s all good having a redundant network design, but putting web servers and the like on our hypervisors doesn’t make them redundant. In the event where there’s a failure on one of our servers, all virtual machines on that server will die. &mldr; <a class=read-more href=/2012/04/13/ha-software/>&#187;</a></p></section><footer class=post-meta><time class=post-date>April 13, 2012</time></footer></article><article class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title><a href=/2012/04/13/ha-network/>High Availability WordPress LAMP Stack.</a></h2></header><section class=post-excerpt><p>Introduction In one of my last little tasks at work, I was asked to eliminate single points of failure in the software and hardware stack without spending a fortune on hardware or software licenses. During the process of ensuring high availability (HA), I realized that many small companies might have similar need, but with more pressing tasks and limited man hours, without a post that talks about all the issues and solutions in one place, many companies and organisations tend to leave single points of failure living with the chance that they’re not going to fail any time soon. &mldr; <a class=read-more href=/2012/04/13/ha-network/>&#187;</a></p></section><footer class=post-meta><time class=post-date>April 13, 2012</time></footer></article><article class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title><a href=/2011/07/02/whats-the-harm-in-google-dns-performance/>What’s the harm in Google DNS?Performance!</a></h2></header><section class=post-excerpt><p>EDIT: It looks like Google has recently starting peering in more places in AU with an anycast solution that fixes these issues.

In part 1 of this blog post, I showed you how I created a script that would, when run, rotate your snapshots on a ZFS filesystem. For this to be usable, we need to create a mechanism for having it be automatically ran. &mldr; <a class=read-more href=/2011/03/24/3-setting-up-filesystems-and-snapshots-part-2/>&#187;</a></p></section><footer class=post-meta><time class=post-date>March 24, 2011</time></footer></article><nav class=pagination role=navigation><a class=newer-posts href=/post/page/2/>&larr; Newer Posts</a>
