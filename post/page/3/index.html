From previous posts you might know I’ve build my OpenIndiana ZFS FileServer. Well, just created a volume and decided to put 300GB to good use to create a time machine on my mac. There is a brilliant guide on how to do it here and suggest you all take a look (Thanks for the awesome guide Marco). &mldr; <a class=read-more href=/2012/07/31/zfs-and-apple-time-machine-a-perfect-team/>&#187;</a></p></section><footer class=post-meta><time class=post-date>July 31, 2012</time></footer></article><article class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title><a href=/2012/07/09/monitoring-srx-chassis-cluster/>Monitoring SRX Chassis Cluster</a></h2></header><section class=post-excerpt><p>Just finishing off a few things at work this week. We’ve got a few sites around the place where we have HA internet powered by two Juniper SRX100’s. The Two SRX100’s operate in a Chassis Cluster and peer with our ISP using BGP across both active/passive devices.
Below is a little Nagios check script that I wrote to hook into our in-house Nagios monitoring platform. It makes sure the chassis cluster has not failed over operating in a degraded state, and makes sure that there are two BGP peers connected. &mldr; <a class=read-more href=/2012/07/09/monitoring-srx-chassis-cluster/>&#187;</a></p></section><footer class=post-meta><time class=post-date>July 09, 2012</time></footer></article><article class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title><a href=/2012/06/03/easily-accessing-geoip-restricted-sites-in-your-network/>Easily accessing GeoIP restricted sites in your network.</a></h2></header><section class=post-excerpt><p>We all know the problem, some sites are restricted to certain countries based on the IP address you’re using to view them.

It’s all good having a redundant network design, but putting web servers and the like on our hypervisors doesn’t make them redundant.

During the process of ensuring high availability (HA), I realized that many small companies might have similar need, but with more pressing tasks and limited man hours, without a post that talks about all the issues and solutions in one place, many companies and organisations tend to leave single points of failure living with the chance that they’re not going to fail any time soon. &mldr; <a class=read-more href=/2012/04/13/ha-network/>&#187;</a></p></section><footer class=post-meta><time class=post-date>April 13, 2012</time></footer></article><article class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title><a href=/2011/07/02/whats-the-harm-in-google-dns-performance/>What’s the harm in Google DNS?Performance!</a></h2></header><section class=post-excerpt><p>EDIT: It looks like Google has recently starting peering in more places in AU with an anycast solution that fixes these issues.

In part 1 of this blog post, I showed you how I created a script that would, when run, rotate your snapshots on a ZFS filesystem. For this to be usable, we need to create a mechanism for having it be automatically ran. &mldr; <a class=read-more href=/2011/03/24/3-setting-up-filesystems-and-snapshots-part-2/>&#187;</a></p></section><footer class=post-meta><time class=post-date>March 24, 2011</time></footer></article><article class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title><a href=/2011/03/18/3-setting-up-filesystems-and-snapshots/>3.

Setting up the FileSystems is a trivial task. First, you can see that when we’ve created a storage pool ‘datastore’ it created a filesystem for us (also called datastore) that can act as a container for child file systems. &mldr; <a class=read-more href=/2011/03/18/3-setting-up-filesystems-and-snapshots/>&#187;</a></p></section><footer class=post-meta><time class=post-date>March 18, 2011</time></footer></article><article class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title><a href=/2011/03/16/2-installing-the-operating-system/>2.

Installing OS and setup Network For the following set of posts, I have chosen to use VirtualBox to run through how to use ZFS in building your FileSystem. The first step is downloading and installing OpenIndiana.
