Setting up the FileSystems is a trivial task.¬†First, you can see that when we‚Äôve created a storage pool ‚Äòdatastore‚Äô it created a filesystem for us (also called datastore) that can act as a container for child file systems. &mldr; <a class=read-more href=/2011/03/18/3-setting-up-filesystems-and-snapshots/>&#187;</a></p></section><footer class=post-meta><time class=post-date>March 18, 2011</time></footer></article><article class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title><a href=/2011/03/16/2-installing-the-operating-system/>2.

Installing OS and setup Network For the following set of posts, I have chosen to use VirtualBox to run through how to use ZFS in building your FileSystem. The first step is downloading and installing OpenIndiana.

The tools I‚Äôll be using for this is my old favourite wget and a new tool, ‚Äúat‚Äù.
The at daemon is required to be running first, so on debian or ubuntu
/etc/init.d/atd start

I&#8217;ve moved into my new area in the study so I&#8217;ve started setting it up how I like. The first step is to get my router set up. The router I&#8217;m using is a little &#8216;fit-pc&#8217; box with two ethernet cables.

One thing I&#8217;ve been meaning to do is to digitise my life and get set up on the cloud. I think it&#8217;ll be really basic to start off with. VPN access in to my home network, firewall everything off, then create a few layers of the network. The issue is that I want to go paperless.

My home network now consists of my D-Link Wireless router being put into Bridge mode, with all services pretty much turned off on the thing. My internal network is 10.12.0.0/16. I plan to sub-divide up this address space later, but for now, I&#8217;m pretty much just keeping it in one big heap until I set up my servers and want to separate them further from the wireless workstations, for this reason though, I&#8217;m keeping my setup pretty simple all pretty much in a 10. &mldr; <a class=read-more href=/2010/11/07/home-networking-is-back/>&#187;</a></p></section><footer class=post-meta><time class=post-date>November 07, 2010</time></footer></article><nav class=pagination role=navigation><a class=newer-posts href=/post/page/3/>&larr; Newer Posts</a>
