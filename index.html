In Network Engineering at Facebook Meta, we&rsquo;ve been going through an interesting transformation in which we&rsquo;re starting to be discouraged to write new services in Python, and, instead start writing more in Rust (and sorry Golang, of which we&rsquo;ve already got a bit written in.
I&rsquo;ve always said that I&rsquo;m not overly a smart person (though am stubborn enough to solve most problems), and don&rsquo;t expect to be able to pick it up quickly, I decided to start learning by challenge tasks, do as much as I can in it, and document some here. &mldr; <a class=read-more href=/post/2022-04-27-learning-rust/>&#187;</a></p></section><footer class=post-meta><time class=post-date>April 27, 2022</time></footer></article><article class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title><a href=/post/2022-04-05-chess-bug/>ESPChess NewGame Bug</a></h2></header><section class=post-excerpt><img src=/post/2022-04-05-chess-bug/logo.pnghugo style=float:right;max-width:200px;margin:20px></img><p>Ordering is a little off here, but I wanted to writeup about a bug I&rsquo;m seeing in the ESPChess project (post to come) and how I intend to fix it.
The chessboard uses AWS IoT Shadow Service (MQTT accessed key-value store) to keep track of your and your opponents chess board state.

From my light study I found the fence and some areas that may make some good light.
I found https://university.upstartfarmers.com/blog/sizing-a-pump-hydroponics-aquaponics that describes NFT Hydroponics is 4-6 GPH required for my pump.

I&rsquo;ve been interested in starting with the Kratky Method of gardening. The idea is to grow lettuce in mason jars and see how growing without soil does. I&rsquo;ve previously enjoyed growing my own alfalfa micro-greens, so this is the next obvious step.
Attempt #1 These didn&rsquo;t go so good. I had planted some seedlings in Rockwool, and left them in a container out in the sun to act as a mini-greenhouse. &mldr; <a class=read-more href=/post/2021-12-kratky-lettuce/>&#187;</a></p></section><footer class=post-meta><time class=post-date>December 05, 2021</time></footer></article><article class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title><a href=/posts/custom-desk/>Custom Study Desk</a></h2></header><section class=post-excerpt><p>My partner and I recently started renting an old place in Palo Alto.

I&rsquo;m no expert in woodwork, so decided to 3D model it before building the desk. This also helped as my father, who&rsquo;s a carpenter, could then give me tips when I shared my computer screen with him (being on other sides of the planet). &mldr; <a class=read-more href=/posts/custom-desk/>&#187;</a></p></section><footer class=post-meta><time class=post-date>November 10, 2021</time></footer></article><article class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title><a href=/post/2021-10-10-light-study/>light-study</a></h2></header><section class=post-excerpt><p>When deciding what to attempt to grow where in the unit we&rsquo;re renting, I decided to perform a light study of the backyard.
