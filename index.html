I bought foam board from Dollar Tree. Having the free designs from Flite Test (Iâ€™m using their Simple Cub), it quickly became apparent that printing out the designs, cutting, lining them up, gluing, cutting takes hours and hours to cut out a design.
I want a CNC machine to do either laser cutting or sawing to save this time. &mldr; <a class=read-more href=/post/mini-cnc/>&#187;</a></p></section><footer class=post-meta><time class=post-date>December 28, 2022</time></footer></article><article class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title><a href=/post/ardupilot-postmortem/>Ardupilot Postmortem</a></h2></header><section class=post-excerpt><img src=/post/ardupilot-postmortem/crash.jpg style=float:right;max-width:200px;margin:20px></img><p>A big thanks to those who helped from the Ardupilot Forum
Last week, I took a few extra days off from work to give myself a nice long break over Thanksgiving week.
I spent a lot of time finishing an RC plane we had some replacement parts for. This one was going to be autonomous. I spent a few days soldering the flight controller and electronics, gluing the plane together, measuring and trimming everything perfectly. &mldr; <a class=read-more href=/post/ardupilot-postmortem/>&#187;</a></p></section><footer class=post-meta><time class=post-date>November 27, 2022</time></footer></article><article class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title><a href=/post/2022-10-05-workflow-orchestration/>workflow-orchestration</a></h2></header><section class=post-excerpt><p>At Meta, we have a few internal workflow orchestration engines.

I&rsquo;ve previously enjoyed growing my own alfalfa micro-greens, so this is the next obvious step.
Attempt #1 These didn&rsquo;t go so good.
