    <p>
      It&#8217;s a new year and time to start getting new years resolutions into action. I&#8217;ve moved into my new area in the study so I&#8217;ve started setting it up how I like.  The first step is to get my router set up. The router I&#8217;m using is a little &#8216;fit-pc&#8217; box with two ethernet cables. As you can see, it&#8217;s pretty tiny but doesn&#8217;t pack much in terms of power. &hellip; <a class="read-more" href="/2011/01/01/happy-new-year-resolution-1-network-data/">&raquo;</a>

      so I&#8217;ve moved back home with the family now. One thing I&#8217;ve been meaning to do is to digitise my life and get set up on the cloud. I think it&#8217;ll be really basic to start off with. VPN access in to my home network, firewall everything off, then create a few layers of the network. The issue is that I want to go paperless. I want to set up a ZFS Fileserver to store and snapshot all my data with remote encrypted backups of important documents and the like. &hellip; <a class="read-more" href="/2010/12/28/new-network/">&raquo;</a>

      so, since I had the scare with my Asterisk VoIP box being hacked and a telephone call to Antarctica having being made, I decided to do something about it. My home network now consists of my D-Link Wireless router being put into Bridge mode, with all services pretty much turned off on the thing. My internal network is 10.12.0.0/16. I plan to sub-divide up this address space later, but for now, I&#8217;m pretty much just keeping it in one big heap until I set up my servers and want to separate them further from the wireless workstations, for this reason though, I&#8217;m keeping my setup pretty simple all pretty much in a 10. &hellip; <a class="read-more" href="/2010/11/07/home-networking-is-back/">&raquo;</a>
