    <p>
      We all know the problem, some sites are restricted to certain countries based on the IP address you’re using to view them. When trying to access over-seas, some solutions are HTTP proxies, Socks proxies and the like. The problem I have with all of these is that they’re annoying to set up whenever you want to to view the site and I don’t want to have to do that for all my devices (iPad, computer, etc). &hellip; <a class="read-more" href="/2012/06/03/easily-accessing-geoip-restricted-sites-in-your-network/">&raquo;</a>

      Setting up the Software Stack This article is the second in a series (see part 1 here). Please see HA Network for the first part in setting up the network topology to be highly available.
It’s all good having a redundant network design, but putting web servers and the like on our hypervisors doesn’t make them redundant. In the event where there’s a failure on one of our servers, all virtual machines on that server will die. &hellip; <a class="read-more" href="/2012/04/13/ha-software/">&raquo;</a>

      Introduction In one of my last little tasks at work, I was asked to eliminate single points of failure in the software and hardware stack without spending a fortune on hardware or software licenses. During the process of ensuring high availability (HA), I realized that many small companies might have similar need, but with more pressing tasks and limited man hours, without a post that talks about all the issues and solutions in one place, many companies and organisations tend to leave single points of failure living with the chance that they’re not going to fail any time soon. &hellip; <a class="read-more" href="/2012/04/13/ha-network/">&raquo;</a>

On a little side note to the tutorial series I’ve been writing up lately for building a ZFS fileserver. This one is about Why Google DNS is bad for your performance (well, depending on where you live) A real quick run down, we all know what DNS does yeah? &hellip; <a class="read-more" href="/2011/07/02/whats-the-harm-in-google-dns-performance/">&raquo;</a>

      I want to write a quick and dirty blog post to tell you a little solution on downloading HTTP files in your off-peak usage using linux.
The tools I’ll be using for this is my old favourite wget and a new tool, “at”.
The at daemon is required to be running first, so on debian or ubuntu
/etc/init.d/atd start
Then downloading your file at an off-peak time (4am for me) is as simple as &hellip; <a class="read-more" href="/2011/01/24/downloading-http-in-off-peak/">&raquo;</a>

      As you may have been aware from my previous blog posts, I&#8217;ve been trying to make my life digital, that means any papers I get, I scan and file on a FileServer (with remote backups, etc, etc). My scanner at home has a document feeder on it. The problem is that it doesn&#8217;t do duplex, only a set of sides. So far, I can scan one side of the document, flip the paper of, then scan the back pages. &hellip; <a class="read-more" href="/2011/01/16/pdf-automator-in-osx/">&raquo;</a>

      It&#8217;s a new year and time to start getting new years resolutions into action. I&#8217;ve moved into my new area in the study so I&#8217;ve started setting it up how I like. The first step is to get my router set up. The router I&#8217;m using is a little &#8216;fit-pc&#8217; box with two ethernet cables. As you can see, it&#8217;s pretty tiny but doesn&#8217;t pack much in terms of power. &hellip; <a class="read-more" href="/2011/01/01/happy-new-year-resolution-1-network-data/">&raquo;</a>
