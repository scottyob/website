Over half a decade. It has been about 12 years since I started this blog, and a lot has changed since then. I&rsquo;ve not found the time to document my tinkerings and projects as work has taken most of my time. I&rsquo;m going to leave work related things on Linkedin, personal posts on Facebook, but I would like to continue using this site as my partner tends to use her diaries, as a way looking back at what I&rsquo;ve been playing with.</p><p>I tend to have more than a few projects going on, and with this being the first of 5 weeks away on recharge from Facebook, my goal throughout is to start using this to document projects I&rsquo;m playing with. With trying to squeeze as much paragliding as I can during this time though we&rsquo;ll see how it goes.</p><p>I had this intention probably 12 months or so ago, when I moved the content of this page over from Workpress to Hugo, and changed the hosting to Github pages, but with a bit of spare time to kickstart this effort now, let&rsquo;s see what happens :)</p></section><footer class=post-footer></footer></article></main><footer class=site-footer><section class=rss><a class="subscribe-button icon-feed" href=/index.xml></a></section><section class=copyright>&copy; 2023 Scott O'Brien</section><section class=poweredby><a href=https://github.com/nirocfz/arabica>Arabica</a> theme by Sean Lunsford.
