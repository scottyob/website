The tools I’ll be using for this is my old favourite wget and a new tool, “at”.
The at daemon is required to be running first, so on debian or ubuntu
/etc/init.d/atd start

The router I&#8217;m using is a little &#8216;fit-pc&#8217; box with two ethernet cables.

VPN access in to my home network, firewall everything off, then create a few layers of the network. The issue is that I want to go paperless.

My home network now consists of my D-Link Wireless router being put into Bridge mode, with all services pretty much turned off on the thing. My internal network is 10.12.0.0/16. I plan to sub-divide up this address space later, but for now, I&#8217;m pretty much just keeping it in one big heap until I set up my servers and want to separate them further from the wireless workstations, for this reason though, I&#8217;m keeping my setup pretty simple all pretty much in a 10. &mldr; <a class=read-more href=/2010/11/07/home-networking-is-back/>&#187;</a></p></section><footer class=post-meta><time class=post-date>November 07, 2010</time></footer></article><article class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title><a href=/2010/11/07/a-dawn-of-a-new-scott/>A dawn of a new Scott</a></h2></header><section class=post-excerpt><p>More blogging to come.
