It&rsquo;s something to play with more later, but I&rsquo;m hoping to start putting these widgets into my logbook app to be able to log flights against tasks when they&rsquo;re done. &mldr; <a class=read-more href=/posts/paratasks/>&#187;</a></p></section><footer class=post-meta><time class=post-date>September 20, 2021</time></footer></article><article class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title><a href=/2021/09/11/resuming/>resuming</a></h2></header><section class=post-excerpt><p>I&rsquo;ve not been writing or blogging for some time.

We wanted to allow proxy-free internet, but wanted to keep an eye on how much data was being consumed by what sort of users. For this we built Project Herbert http://uowits.github.io/herbert-gui/docs.html.
It uses netflow from inside our network and some syslog monitoring scripts to match up our private RFC1918 address space to the users who have it at that time, process the flows in near-realtime so we can adjust throttling and firewall policy to be reactive with the environment. &mldr; <a class=read-more href=/2014/07/08/user-accounting-with-netflow/>&#187;</a></p></section><footer class=post-meta><time class=post-date>July 08, 2014</time></footer></article><article class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title><a href=/2014/05/08/logging-nat-translations-on-the-cisco-asa/>Logging NAT Translations on the Cisco ASA</a></h2></header><section class=post-excerpt><p>It’s often handy when dealing with infringement notices and the like to have NAT translations logged.

With a L3 to the edge design though this means that while every edge switch has its own address space (per VRF), it also has a /30 uplink (once again, per VRF) back to the PE device.
While this (rightly or wrongly decided) slightly more complicated design in itself isn’t a problem, I’ve been working on programatically putting all of this data into an IPAM (IP Address Management) solution. &mldr; <a class=read-more href=/2014/02/24/finding-overlaps-in-address-space/>&#187;</a></p></section><footer class=post-meta><time class=post-date>February 24, 2014</time></footer></article><article class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title><a href=/2014/01/29/automating-vlan-changes-for-esxi-switchports-in-cisco-ios/>Automating VLAN changes for ESXi Switchports in Cisco IOS.</a></h2></header><section class=post-excerpt><p>At the organisation I’m currently working for, we recently experienced what appears to be a common issue, VLAN’s trunked down to ESXi nodes were inconsistent.
