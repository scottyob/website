I bought foam board from Dollar Tree. Having the free designs from Flite Test (I’m using their Simple Cub), it quickly became apparent that printing out the designs, cutting, lining them up, gluing, cutting takes hours and hours to cut out a design.
I want a CNC machine to do either laser cutting or sawing to save this time.</description></item><item><title>Ardupilot Postmortem</title><link>https://www.scottyob.com/post/ardupilot-postmortem/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/post/ardupilot-postmortem/</guid><description>A big thanks to those who helped from the Ardupilot Forum
Last week, I took a few extra days off from work to give myself a nice long break over Thanksgiving week.
I spent a lot of time finishing an RC plane we had some replacement parts for. This one was going to be autonomous. I spent a few days soldering the flight controller and electronics, gluing the plane together, measuring and trimming everything perfectly.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://www.scottyob.com/flying/flights/243/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/flying/flights/243/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://www.scottyob.com/flying/flights/242/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/flying/flights/242/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://www.scottyob.com/flying/flights/241/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/flying/flights/241/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://www.scottyob.com/flying/flights/240/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/flying/flights/240/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://www.scottyob.com/flying/flights/238/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/flying/flights/238/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://www.scottyob.com/flying/flights/239/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/flying/flights/239/</guid><description/></item><item><title>workflow-orchestration</title><link>https://www.scottyob.com/post/2022-10-05-workflow-orchestration/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/post/2022-10-05-workflow-orchestration/</guid><description>At Meta, we have a few internal workflow orchestration engines. The idea is to allow long-running jobs, or things that can be split into tasks and need to have safe &amp;ldquo;checkpoints&amp;rdquo; behind them be defined in a system that can safely execute them and make sure they&amp;rsquo;re executed in a durable, reliable and scalable way.
As I stumble upon things that fit paradigms within Facebook externally, this page is to document them.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://www.scottyob.com/flying/flights/236/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/flying/flights/236/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://www.scottyob.com/flying/flights/237/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/flying/flights/237/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://www.scottyob.com/flying/flights/235/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/flying/flights/235/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://www.scottyob.com/flying/flights/233/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/flying/flights/233/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://www.scottyob.com/flying/flights/234/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/flying/flights/234/</guid><description/></item><item><title>rockwool-stand</title><link>https://www.scottyob.com/post/2022-09-08-rockwool-stand/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/post/2022-09-08-rockwool-stand/</guid><description>Last time I did hydroponic growing and germinated seeds in the rockwool, I found it annoying that the roots would grow out the bottom of the rockwool, then get squished by the ground, making it harder to have dangling roots to easily transfer to an NFT system.

In Network Engineering at Facebook Meta, we&amp;rsquo;ve been going through an interesting transformation in which we&amp;rsquo;re starting to be discouraged to write new services in Python, and, instead start writing more in Rust (and sorry Golang, of which we&amp;rsquo;ve already got a bit written in.
I&amp;rsquo;ve always said that I&amp;rsquo;m not overly a smart person (though am stubborn enough to solve most problems), and don&amp;rsquo;t expect to be able to pick it up quickly, I decided to start learning by challenge tasks, do as much as I can in it, and document some here.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://www.scottyob.com/flying/flights/230/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/flying/flights/230/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://www.scottyob.com/flying/flights/229/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/flying/flights/229/</guid><description/></item><item><title>ESPChess NewGame Bug</title><link>https://www.scottyob.com/post/2022-04-05-chess-bug/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/post/2022-04-05-chess-bug/</guid><description>Ordering is a little off here, but I wanted to writeup about a bug I&amp;rsquo;m seeing in the ESPChess project (post to come) and how I intend to fix it.
The chessboard uses AWS IoT Shadow Service (MQTT accessed key-value store) to keep track of your and your opponents chess board state. It has a sequence number that&amp;rsquo;s incremeneted to flag when we should update our current state to match our opponents.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://www.scottyob.com/flying/flights/228/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/flying/flights/228/</guid><description/></item><item><title>NFT Hydroponic System</title><link>https://www.scottyob.com/post/2022-01-02-nft-hydroponics/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/post/2022-01-02-nft-hydroponics/</guid><description>As my hydroponic experiemnt has shown success, I wanted to scale this up. My plan is to build an NFT hydroponic system for the yard, and dutch bucket for tomatoes.
From my light study I found the fence and some areas that may make some good light.
I found https://university.upstartfarmers.com/blog/sizing-a-pump-hydroponics-aquaponics that describes NFT Hydroponics is 4-6 GPH required for my pump. I&amp;rsquo;m going to start with one trough, but plan on scaling this up to 3 if it works, so will require 18GPH of total flow.</description></item><item><title>Hydroponic Kratky Lettuce Attempts</title><link>https://www.scottyob.com/post/2021-12-kratky-lettuce/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Dec 2021 11:01:04 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/post/2021-12-kratky-lettuce/</guid><description>This year i&amp;rsquo;ve decided to start playing with Hydroponics as a hobby. I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in starting with the Kratky Method of gardening. The idea is to grow lettuce in mason jars and see how growing without soil does. I&amp;rsquo;ve previously enjoyed growing my own alfalfa micro-greens, so this is the next obvious step.
Attempt #1 These didn&amp;rsquo;t go so good. I had planted some seedlings in Rockwool, and left them in a container out in the sun to act as a mini-greenhouse.</description></item><item><title>Custom Study Desk</title><link>https://www.scottyob.com/posts/custom-desk/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/posts/custom-desk/</guid><description>My partner and I recently started renting an old place in Palo Alto. With COVID, we&amp;rsquo;ve been working from home for almost two years now, and sharing a desk at times things felt a little cramped (especially with the occsional electronics project).
I&amp;rsquo;m no expert in woodwork, so decided to 3D model it before building the desk. This also helped as my father, who&amp;rsquo;s a carpenter, could then give me tips when I shared my computer screen with him (being on other sides of the planet).</description></item><item><title>light-study</title><link>https://www.scottyob.com/post/2021-10-10-light-study/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/post/2021-10-10-light-study/</guid><description>When deciding what to attempt to grow where in the unit we&amp;rsquo;re renting, I decided to perform a light study of the backyard.

Once a scan is performed, I exported this to obj format, and loaded it into my favourite Blender

May 2020 00:46:16 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/page/bucketlist/</guid><description>Preface The bucket list started on my website back in February, 2013. The idea was start creating a list of all of the things that I&amp;rsquo;ve accomplished over the years, and keep track of the things that I really want to achieve and experience in my life.
This list is public in the hope others will want to help or experience things with me and help make these happen. This list is ever growing and changing.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://www.scottyob.com/flying/flights/153/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 May 2020 00:00:00

Usually this isn’t such a big problem, but add that with a design decision to route right to the access layer of our campus network with a multi-VRF network and you can start to see how mistakes, or changes in design along the deployment has meant inconsistencies.</description></item><item><title>User Accounting with Netflow</title><link>https://www.scottyob.com/2014/07/08/user-accounting-with-netflow/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2014 05:54:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/2014/07/08/user-accounting-with-netflow/</guid><description>At UOW we had a challenge. We wanted to allow proxy-free internet, but wanted to keep an eye on how much data was being consumed by what sort of users. For this we built Project Herbert http://uowits.github.io/herbert-gui/docs.html.
It uses netflow from inside our network and some syslog monitoring scripts to match up our private RFC1918 address space to the users who have it at that time, process the flows in near-realtime so we can adjust throttling and firewall policy to be reactive with the environment.</description></item><item><title>Logging NAT Translations on the Cisco ASA</title><link>https://www.scottyob.com/2014/05/08/logging-nat-translations-on-the-cisco-asa/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2014 06:14:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/2014/05/08/logging-nat-translations-on-the-cisco-asa/</guid><description>It’s often handy when dealing with infringement notices and the like to have NAT translations logged.

With a L3 to the edge design though this means that while every edge switch has its own address space (per VRF), it also has a /30 uplink (once again, per VRF) back to the PE device.
While this (rightly or wrongly decided) slightly more complicated design in itself isn’t a problem, I’ve been working on programatically putting all of this data into an IPAM (IP Address Management) solution.</description></item><item><title>Automating VLAN changes for ESXi Switchports in Cisco IOS.</title><link>https://www.scottyob.com/2014/01/29/automating-vlan-changes-for-esxi-switchports-in-cisco-ios/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jan 2014 10:51:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/2014/01/29/automating-vlan-changes-for-esxi-switchports-in-cisco-ios/</guid><description>At the organisation I’m currently working for, we recently experienced what appears to be a common issue, VLAN’s trunked down to ESXi nodes were inconsistent.
